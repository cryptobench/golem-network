    title: "Golem Beta V - Web Application Development toolset!",
    slug: "beta-v-release",
    html: '<p>Beta V is here with bundled major updates to <a href="https://github.com/golemfactory/yagna/#golem">Yagna</a> and the Yagna Python API, <a href="https://github.com/golemfactory/yapapi#golem-python-api">Yapapi</a>! Our last update, <a href="https://blog.golemproject.net/beta-iv-release/">Beta IV</a>, made the fees much lower across the board, allowing requestors and providers to run more cost-efficient tasks. <br><br>Beta V includes <a href="https://github.com/golemfactory/yagna/releases/tag/v0.10.0">Yagna v0.10.0</a>, codenamed <em>Fishing Rod</em>. This version of Yagna includes the feature of <a href="https://handbook.golem.network/payments/payments-explained#mid-agreement-payments">mid-agreement payments</a>, which is a mechanism allowing to pay the provider at set points in time during the duration of an agreement. This is an essential function to enable tasks or services to run for long periods of time. This will also confirm that the requestor is still online at any point after a task is sent, to prevent long-term computations that would never get paid. For more information on the improvements to payments, we’d recommend the intro to <a href="https://handbook.golem.network/payments/payments-explained">payments in the handbook</a>.</p><p>Another addition to Golem is the <a href="https://github.com/golemfactory/ya-runtime-http-auth">Yagna HTTP Authentication Runtime</a> (<code>ya-runtime-http-auth</code>) which serves as a gateway between the Golem Marketplace and an HTTP-based service accessible over the Internet. This is separate from the Yagna binaries. To learn more, the <a href="https://github.com/golemfactory/ya-runtime-http-auth#ya-runtime-http-auth">repository\'s README includes an overview</a>. You can also find <a href="https://github.com/golemfactory/yapapi/blob/mf/http-auth-example/examples/http-auth/http_auth.py">example cod</a>e using the Yagna Python API.</p><p>Beta V also includes <a href="https://github.com/golemfactory/yapapi/releases/tag/0.9.0">Yapapi v0.9.0</a>. This Yapapi update has a new events interface that allows users to have a cleaner, easier to understand, and easier to debug experience when using events. This new events interface also allows requestors to code an event handler for any selected events. Yapapi also has another update that allows the requestors to easily control and limit the tasks sent to a specific provider.</p><p>From a developer and requestor perspective, the local HTTP proxy functionality could be considered the most interesting part of this release. The HTTP proxy feature was introduced briefly in the Beta IV release, with the very basic example covered in the <a href="https://youtu.be/j9FXs29aWgk?t=599">Requestor Walk-through</a> video. Since then the local HTTP proxy module has been added to the recently-created <a href="https://yapapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#local-http-proxy">yapapi.contrib</a> as a reusable component, available out of the box to external developers. Think of this as a part of the toolset for developing web applications on Golem.</p><p>In the video below, we dive into a short presentation and demonstration for a Golem WebApp on Yapapi’s Service API:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DZoglUVc4eQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><figcaption>Przemysław “BlueShade” Idzkiewicz, Senior Software Engineer at Golem, demonstrates a web application consisting of an rqlite (based on SQLite) database back-end and Flask https server.</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://blog.golemproject.net/beta-v-release/#:~:text=Rewards%20for%20individuals%20giving%20feedback%20and%20developing%20on%20the%20new%20release">Near the end of this blog</a> we share how you can get rewarded with GLM for trying out and giving feedback on this release.</p><h2 id="how-do-i-upgrade-or-install-golem"><strong>How do I upgrade or install Golem?</strong></h2><p>To upgrade or install Golem, both will be the same for a requestor or a provider. If it’s your first time running Golem, we would recommend going through the <a href="https://handbook.golem.network/">Golem handbook</a> to learn more about how to interact with the Yagna software.</p><p><a href="https://handbook.golem.network/requestor-tutorials/flash-tutorial-of-requestor-development">Requestor</a>:</p><p><code>curl -sSf https://join.golem.network/as-requestor | bash -</code></p><p><a href="https://handbook.golem.network/requestor-tutorials/flash-tutorial-of-requestor-development">Here you can find the section specific to requestors in the handbook</a> and the Golem Python API Reference, which is the  main entrypoint of Golem\'s high-level API, is available at <a href="https://yapapi.readthedocs.io/">yapapi.readthedocs.io</a>.</p><p><a href="https://handbook.golem.network/provider-tutorials/provider-tutorial">Provider</a>:</p><p><code>curl -sSf https://join.golem.network/as-provider | bash -</code></p><p>The “<a href="https://handbook.golem.network/provider-tutorials/provider-tutorial">Becoming a provider</a>” section of the handbook will be useful to you in the scenario that this is your first time getting started as a Golem provider.</p><h3 id="security">Security</h3><p>As security advice, which we give in almost all releases for both requestors and providers, you should be backing up your keys if you have mainnet tokens. You can back up your keys to your wallet with the following export command (while Golem is running):</p><p><code>yagna id export --file-path=./key.json</code></p><p>If you’re just getting started with Golem for the first time, you want to go to the <a href="https://handbook.golem.network/">handbook</a>. It includes the installation steps as a Provider or Requestor, along with explanations and important details such as Command-Line Interface (CLI).</p><h3 id="rewards-for-individuals-giving-feedback-and-developing-on-the-new-release">Rewards for individuals giving feedback and developing on the new release</h3><p>We wanted to remind you all about our <a href="https://blog.golemproject.net/community-incentives-program/#:~:text=Golem%20Community%20Incentives%20Program%20(CIP,improvement%20of%20the%20Golem%20community.">GLM Rewards Program</a>. We have up to 20 slots, per month, to receive rewards to, totaling up to a maximum of 25000 GLM per month given away. If you want to participate, join us on Reddit, Twitter, Discord, and Telegram.</p><p>We would also like to mention that we are officially changing the “Tech Supporters” GLM allocation and the “Application Creation and Maintenance” GLM allocation. This means that up to 3 individuals, each month, who create and maintain applications using the Golem Network, can earn 4,000 GLM. The Tech Supporter category has been updated to be 500 GLM split between 1-2 tech supporters per month.</p><p>For this release in particular, we would love to see individuals trying out the new Yapapi local HTTP proxy functionality and giving us feedback. If you’re a developer, then please consider getting involved in creating your own web application. For this task we can offer both <a href="https://blog.golemproject.net/community-incentives-program/#:~:text=Incentives%20Categories">Application Creation and Maintenance</a> and <a href="https://blog.golemproject.net/community-incentives-program/#:~:text=is%20for%20you!-,Rewards,-%3A">Feedback Master</a> together, with a potential reward of up to 5,000 GLM.</p><h2 id="thank-you-"><strong>Thank you!</strong></h2><p>Thank you for reading the Beta V announcement. We look forward to receiving your feedback and learning about your experience. You can reach us via email, <a href="https://chat.golem.network/">Discord</a>, and please keep us in the loop with your latest endeavours when building on Golem, we’d be happy to include applications in <a href="https://github.com/golemfactory/awesome-golem">Awesome Golem</a>!</p>',

In this blog we will cover many of our plans for this year.</p><h3 id="thorg">Thorg</h3><p>Thorg began as a small and stubby dwarf coming into the decentralized space. For 2022 he’s looking to grow to being less small <em>but</em> even more stubby, to be able to fit in all the new features in his belly.</p><p>The new features for Thorg planned for 2022 include: CPU tasks, gamification, more mining engines, affiliation programme, income &amp; usage dashboard in the Thorg UI, extended customization, and experimental features (e.g. generic GPU task). Look out for updates on <a href="https://twitter.com/minewiththorg">Thorg’s Twitter</a>!</p><h3 id="golem-as-a-dapp-stack">Golem as a DApp Stack</h3><p>People willing to buy services running on Golem value decentralization as a concept, for this reason, we would like to create platform for developers of DApps as our potential target group.</p><p>Our goal is to create a convenient environment for DApps with extensive tutorials showing how to leverage the Golem platform. We aim to make these tutorials a smooth and easier way for developers to deploy their applications compared to typical cloud platforms. </p><p>For 2021 we’re aware that we’re not there yet, however, we have established low-level advantages and building blocks to give an advantage over centralized platforms. Such as there being no need for a registered account or formal agreement, payments are being settled continuously in contrast to the usual monthly invoicing for monthly services.</p><p>We will be slipping this path to Golem as a DApp Stack into two steps:</p><p><strong>Part 1 - Late June / July 2022</strong><br>Create SDK for writing simple web applications. We aim to make this to be able to be deployed without the requestor node constantly running in the background.</p><p>Imagine visiting a website made specifically for deploying such apps, Yaml deployment descriptor and paying with MetaMask for hosting and deployment, from that point, the application is being run on the Golem Network. Part 1 we will treat as proof-of-concept (PoC) and is slated to be ready around late June / July 2022. </p><p><strong>Part 2 - November 2022</strong><br>The more complicated sections following the PoC will be in the 2nd half of the year. In contrast to Part 1, this will include the ability to create applications integrated with the blockchain. The ServiceAPI SDK will need to be more aligned to that of Web3.</p><p>Part 2 will be a bit more interactive with the community where we hope to organize a workshop with DApp creators to get involved in formulating the smoothest experience and onboarding flow. This will involve multiple iterations, and in the end, we’re aiming to have sample DApps, for example:</p><ul><li>Simple decentralized exchange (DEX)</li><li>Lending application</li><li>Oracles</li><li>Gasless forwarder</li></ul><h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3><p>We’re aware of many challenges that we will face, and are currently facing (challenges are a good thing!). We need to create a reputation system both for the benefit of requestors and providers.</p><ol><li>For the requestors, this would help them to choose the best performing providers for their needs. For the provider, it will make it easier for them to decide which requestors they would like to offer their computational services on the marketplace.</li><li>We need incoming and outgoing network access (such as access to Geth and/or IPFS nodes) to allow the DApps to be able to flourish. This requires us to enable access from the internet to DApps, with the integration of easy-to-remember names (e.g. DNS or ENS). This will probably also require some sort of firewall or packet filter to help guarantee safety for our providers, at the same time as giving access to the DApp running in containers. </li><li>Payment architecture so that an application can run without an active requestor. We like to refer to this as “Unstoppable services”. </li><li>Another of our challenges will be to create persistent storage in the form of a <em>Persistence API</em>. So that we can make the network resistant to loss of data on individual provider nodes or incorrect operations. We’re investigating NoSQL databases or doing some sort of side-chain that can help nodes with synchronization. </li></ol><h3 id="unstoppable-golem-services">Unstoppable Golem Services</h3><p>Currently, services on Golem (introduced in <a href="https://blog.golemproject.net/beta-ii-release/">Beta II</a>) will stop when the requestor stops their Yagna daemon or Golem reaches the 10 hour limit for a task, but we want to go beyond that in 2022. What this would be likely to look like would be with the use of a smart contract, either on Ethereum or potentially Polygon, to create a payment stream for the service to continue to run on the provider. This could require a multi-sig contract where providers can vote on particular actions.</p><p>To create this, we’re considering a model where a guild of many providers works together to deliver services that are both safe and reliable. The providers of a guild will form a consensus mechanism where they check each other\'s health, verify actions, and vote on the following: including or excluding new providers to the guild, and taking on new tasks. The decision resolving would be on-chain.</p><p>The main goal of the guild would be that the service runs, works smoothly, and is resilient to failures on singular provider nodes, in contrast to the current version of Golem which has no resilience to this yet!</p><h3 id="token-visibility">Token Visibility</h3><p>We want a smooth experience with the GLM token. For this, in 2022 we look to focus on visibility on various fronts:</p><ul><li>Oracles for GLM</li><li>Support for GLM on different platforms (e.g. Compound)</li><li>Applications for playing with GLM</li><li>Staking mechanisms (which would likely require a new type of token in the Golem ecosystem)</li><li>More chain integration</li></ul><h2 id="wanting-to-learn-more-and-keep-closer-up-to-date">Wanting to learn more and keep closer up to date?</h2><p>This has been a high-level overview of what we’re planning for Yagna, Thorg and the GLM token for the year of 2022. There are some items outside of these main topics that we will give more light to when they’ve solidified.</p><p>For those interested in taking a closer look into Golem, the <a href="https://github.com/golemfactory/">Golem GitHub</a> is a great resource; for example, you can follow the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/golemfactory/projects/23">”.Core” projects page</a> to see what the Golem core developers are getting into. In addition, we’ve started working around Golem Amendment Proposal (<a href="https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-architecture/projects/1">GAPs</a>), which we plan to cover more in a future blog.</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to read this blog!

    html: '<p>Welcome to our summary of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GolemProject/comments/ryemit/welcome_to_the_winter_edition_golem_ama_january/">Reddit AMA for Jan 2022</a> - we let out a lot of secrets that we’ve been holding in for quite some time. The questions revolved around two main topics: the Golem ecosystem, and the future of the Golem Network team.</p><h2 id="the-golem-ecosystem">The Golem Ecosystem</h2><p>Many people have been asking what can be hosted on Golem right now, what can be filtered, and what’s the most profitable way to be a host. These questions are very technical, and may vary a lot depending on what is available; so, we will try to make this as simple as possible. </p><p>In regard to what will be able to be hosted in the future, we are putting incoming/outgoing network communications in the pipeline, as well as unstoppable services (services that don’t require a requester to be online 24/7), and some type of trust management to help facilitate these two functions. One very exciting piece of information that was announced was that ARM support is coming this year.</p><p>Once <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GolemProject/comments/ryemit/comment/hsdbqlb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">ARM support</a> comes along, recommended builds may change. Currently, any build with <a href="https://stats.golem.network/">more than 2 cores/threads</a> is sufficient to run on Golem, but we do not recommend buying new computers/servers solely to host on Golem. At one point, <a href="https://blog.golemproject.net/deep-dive-into-our-collaboration-with-allchemy/">LIFE@Golem</a> would only allow for 24 cores or more to run their programs, and a number of users found this to be very profitable for them; when LIFE@Golem started analyzing their data, many of these high-core computers were turned off, as they likely used more electricity than your average computer would.</p><p>Currently, requestors can rent computer power and filter based on processor type (e.g. Intel/AMD), disk-space, RAM, cores/threads, and prices. If requestors don’t find your internet speed or compute power adequate, then they can filter a specific provider out of their criteria, so the provider won’t receive a request to get paid for computing power.</p><h3 id="the-future-of-the-golem-network">The Future of the Golem Network</h3><p>We unofficially announced that some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GolemProject/comments/ryemit/comment/hsdbqlb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">SWAG</a> would be coming out, in Q1 or Q2, for all the people who obtained a POAP from the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GolemProject/comments/qui9dr/golem_5_year_anniversary_gettogether_is_happening/">5-year anniversary of Golem</a>! On top of that, we got to share our favorite parts of the future of Golem. We discussed dApps on Golem, CPU/GPU tasks on Thorg, and DeFi.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>That’s all for now, we would like to thank our community for asking many challenging questions, and firing interesting discussions about the future ahead of us.</p><p>Here are some resources for you to learn more and keep up with the Golem Project.</p><p>Website: <a href="https://golem.network/">https://golem.network/</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/golemproject">https://twitter.com/golemproject</a></p><p>Discord Chat: <a href="https://chat.golem.network/">https://chat.golem.network/</a></p><p>Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/golemproject/">https://www.facebook.com/golemproject/</a></p><p>Youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl3fxgrSML2sL3UYZrynbMg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl3fxgrSML2sL3UYZrynbMg</a></p><p>Github: <a href="https://github.com/golemfactory">https://github.com/golemfactory</a></p><p>Handbook: <a href="https://handbook.golem.network/">https://handbook.golem.network/</a></p>',

    html: '<p>We’ve just moved from 2021 to 2022 and with that, we’d like to do a summary concluding the year just passed. Let\'s dive in!</p><p>Golem has had a number of significant milestones this year, like being included in The World Bank and Future Today Institute’s <a href="https://futuretodayinstitute.com/trends/">2021 Tech Trend Report</a> - a stepping stone for us, for the community and for decentralized web projects everywhere. We started the year with <a href="https://blog.golemproject.net/meet-the-winners-golem-gitcoin-hackathon-2020/">Golem’s first Hackathon</a>, which resulted in us finding one of our now very treasured developer’s, the Software Ninja, Paweł Burgchardt who created <a href="https://chessongolem.app/">ChessOnGolem</a> used in our 30k GLM <a href="https://blog.golemproject.net/golem-chess-competition/">Golem Chess Competition</a>. Later we had the <a href="https://blog.golemproject.net/golem-gitcoin-gr9-hackathon-2021-winners/">Golem GR9</a> and <a href="https://blog.golemproject.net/golem-online-hackathon/">Golem Online Hackathon</a>.</p><p>The mainnet launch for the Golem (Yagna) was launched on March 11th in the form of the <a href="https://blog.golemproject.net/mainnet-release-beta-i/">Beta I</a>. This new implementation was built from the ground up to be modular, lightweight and easier to build on with the Golem APIs (e.g. the <a href="https://yapapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html">Yagna Python API / Yapapi</a>). This all combined with our <a href="https://handbook.golem.network/">Handbook</a> forms the SDK for Yagna. Here’s a visualization of the <a href="http://youtu.be/1LEuJ9jNk9U">Golem Network ecosystem</a> development.</p><p>Early on we ran a <a href="https://blog.golemproject.net/golem-meme-contest/">Meme Contest</a> which was super fun, we collected many of the amazing memes throughout the year and submissions to the contest and threw them in a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/z0jv9i24kprbd8t/AAD2FfmmOOCC2obdX4wDg_4Pa?dl=0">dropbox</a> for everyone to use! Around the same time, we participated in and created a workshop for the <a href="https://gist.github.com/zakaprov/5366bffa49b3c116748bf9b5b73c602c">Hello Decentralization’s online event</a>. And 0xHack shortly there after, with <a href="https://youtu.be/FmrdyU90NVE?t=302">Maria Paula</a> holding a talk and Kuba’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UoZWC9XI2g">workshop</a> for developers.</p><p>Our star tech supporter Phillip showed some new skills, creating the <a href="https://stats.golem.network/">Golem Stats</a> page with the help of community collaboration+input for which <a href="https://blog.golemproject.net/golem-stats-timeline/">we created a timeline</a>.</p><p>Later in 2021, we celebrated the Golem 5 Year anniversary with an awesome online community meet-up and gave some love via POAP NFTs. During the year we gave out over 48,000 GLM and 83,180 USDC for hackathons and bounties, along with other milestones that we were excited to celebrate:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure class="kg-card-embed" style="width: 100vw">\n\t<video controls width="800">\n\n    \t<source src="https://drive.google.com/u/5/uc?id=1FjntrevDpiyUBu9aOLEARcIbPKZJM3WE&export=download"\n            \ttype="video/mp4">\n    \t<source src="https://drive.google.com/u/5/uc?id=1FjntrevDpiyUBu9aOLEARcIbPKZJM3WE&export=download"\n            \ttype="video/ogg">\n\n    Sorry, your browser doesn\'t support embedded videos.\n\t</video>\n</figure><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The GLM Rewards Program was no small addition on-top of the bounties, giving 220,000 GLM to in community rewards for the year, giving the program more than 335k GLM rewarded to the community across its lifespan so far.</p><p>Polygon collaboration <a href="https://blog.golemproject.net/golem-polygon-ecosystem-for-a-new-payment-driver/">announcement</a> led to the implementation of Polygon payments first on <a href="https://thorg.io/">Thorg</a> and later on the Golem Network with the release of the <a href="https://blog.golemproject.net/beta-iv-release/">Beta IV</a>, the fourth major beta release of Yagna for the year. Since then there have been &gt;<a href="https://polygonscan.com/token/0x0b220b82f3ea3b7f6d9a1d8ab58930c064a2b5bf">350k GLM transfers</a> on Polygon.</p><p><a href="https://blog.golemproject.net/mine-with-thorg/">Thorg</a> came in with a bang and he’s just getting started. He’s the first implementation of GPU mining (ETH and ETC) with layer 2 GLM payouts.

    html: '<p>Hi there! We hope you all are having <a href="https://twitter.com/golemproject/status/1474675031217258497">a happy holiday season</a>. This is a quick blog to update you on two on-going items important to the Golem community. First is the Golem Provider Subsidy (ZkSync to Polygon), and second will be the Golem Chess Competition of which there is still one more prize remaining!</p><h2 id="golem-provider-subsidy-update">Golem Provider Subsidy Update</h2><p>The <a href="https://blog.golemproject.net/glm-provider-subsidy/">Golem Provider Subsidy - ZkSync to Polygon</a> began almost two weeks ago and we’d like to do a push to get as many providers to upgrade before the conclusion of the subsidy, on January 13th. So far there have been 121 providers who’ve been transferred a total of ~3600 GLM.</p><p>If you’ve run a Yagna provider node in the past then you’re on the eligibility list. All you need to do is to spin up your provider node with the latest version (<a href="https://blog.golemproject.net/golem-beta-iv-patch-release-v0-9-1/">v0.9.1</a>) and run it to allow for the subsidy scanner to find the node, <strong>before January 13th</strong>. The scanner is checking each day for eligible providers that have updated to the latest version. Following which your node address will be put in queue to receive the Polygon GLM transfer.</p><p>Over the Christmas weekend, the scanner discovered 4 more eligible nodes although there are hundreds more on the Golem Provider Subsidy eligibility list. <strong>Don’t miss out</strong>!</p><h2 id="golem-chess-competition-update">Golem Chess Competition Update</h2><p>The first<a href="https://blog.golemproject.net/golem-chess-competition/"> Chess on Golem Tournament</a> is running with one slot (3rd prize - 5000 GLM) remaining!</p><p>An outstanding 1100+ human vs Chess on Golem games have been played as part of this tournament, and multiple masters came out to claim victory over Chess on Golem.</p><h3 id="winners">Winners</h3><ul><li>The first player, teoeo#2927, claimed the prize of 15k GLM by<a href="https://chessongolem.app/game/1601"> defeating</a> the Grand Master Level.</li><li>The second player, Yellowdragoon#1476. claimed the prize of 10k GLM by<a href="https://chessongolem.app/game/1816"> defeating</a> the Grand Master Level.</li><li>The third player, Highlynontrivial#5979, claimed the prize of 5k GLM by defeating the Experienced Level. </li></ul><h3 id="winner-s-backgrounds">Winner’s Backgrounds</h3><p>Our winners came from a wide range of countries and ratings, with teoeo#2927 being a freshly named national master (NM) in the USA, with a FIDE elo of <a href="http://www.uschess.org/msa/MbrDtlMain.php?12848787">2204</a>. Teoeo is well known on <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/teoeo">Chess.com</a> as being a strong player overall. Teoeo is well versed in the London System, and positionally superior compared to other players at his current elo.</p><p>Yellowdragoon#1476 is a FIDE master who hails from Ireland with a current elo of <a href="https://ratings.fide.com/profile/2508524/chart">2315</a>! Yellowdragoon#1476 has shown how well he excels at blitz games by winning the majority of games on the FIDE stage as both white and black.</p><p>Highlynontrivial#5979 is a FIDE master who comes from Australia with an elo of 2005! He excels at playing standard games with the black pieces. He\'s played well over 2000 games in just the last 3 years! </p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>If you’ve ever run as a Golem Provider with the latest implementation (Yagna) then you most likely have some GLM allocated to be transferred to your address on Polygon. So all you old-timers out there, dust off your node, upgrade and get your GLM that you earned on ZkSync reflected on Polygon.</p><p>A quick thank you to the winners and contributors of the Golem Chess Competition so far, it was extraordinary to see such skills chess players come to the Golem community and beat the Golem Network in chess. We also had great community feedback by two individuals (Arald#3425 and wannabe2700#9172) which helped us improve the competition in places where the guidelines had some holes. The 3rd prize is still remaining!</p>',

This release, codenamed Human Solidarity (<a href="https://github.com/golemfactory/yagna/releases/tag/v0.9.1">v0.9.1</a>), addresses the priority issues noticed from the major release.</p><p>On the provider side, we noticed an important issue that needs to be addressed in 0.9.0 where it was difficult to set pricing with the CLi (this needed a workaround to be changed). Included in this patch is Pull Request (PR) <a href="https://github.com/golemfactory/yagna/pull/1766">#1766</a>. This fixes all settings invocations (i.e. golemsp settings set). Provider settings can now be properly updated via golemsp (pricing, nodename, etc).</p><p>A minor change to the Payment Service is also included in the Human Solidarity patch, PR <a href="https://github.com/golemfactory/yagna/pull/1763">#1763</a> Fixes gas price setting.

    title: "GLM Provider Subsidy - ZkSync to Polygon",
    slug: "glm-provider-subsidy",
    html: '<p>Last week Golem released its <a href="https://blog.golemproject.net/beta-iv-release/">Beta IV</a>, which includes Polygon support. This is a new payment driver that marks a decrease of ~150x the transaction fees of our previously used as default ZkSync payment driver. The costs of on-boarding and off-boarding are even greater. We expect that, over time, Polygon is where the majority of GLM mainnet transfers will be occurring on the Golem Network.</p><p>In the major release blog, we had a section on “<a href="https://blog.golemproject.net/beta-iv-release/#:~:text=What%20does%20this%20mean%20for%20GLM%20on%20ZkSync%3F">What does this mean for GLM on ZkSync?</a>” mentioned to look out for our <em>GLM Provider Subsidy</em>—and it’s here! We are supporting our committed Providers of the Golem Network to give back some of the fees that Providers might experience if they’re off-boarding their tokens from ZkSync. These GLM token transfers will occur on Polygon.</p><h3 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h3><p>To be eligible for the GLM Provider Subsidy you need to have run as a Golem Provider to the point that you’ve earned GLM on ZkSync.</p><p>Yesterday (Dec 13th 21:00 CET) we froze the list of the zkSync addresses eligible for the subsidy. So <strong>eligibility is already determined and those eligible are on the list</strong>, queued to receive their GLM subsidy. This is the reason we were recommending <a href="https://blog.golemproject.net/beta-iv-release/#:~:text=Until%20that%20announcement%20where%20we%20will%20elaborate%20much%20more%2C%20we%27d%20recommend%20not%20exiting%20any%20tokens%20from%20ZkSync">in the Beta IV announcement</a> for Providers not to exit any tokens from ZkSync, until this announcement.</p><p>The tokens on the Provider ZkSync address will be matched and transferred to the address on Polygon. There will be a cap for subsidy of 200 GLM where this is the maximum amount transferred to the same address Polygon.</p><p>The current fee for exiting tokens from ZkSync to Ethereum is roughly ~50 GLM  (as of 15:00 CET, today). So for a portion of the really committed Golem Providers, this subsidy will have a bonus on top of compensating for the cost.</p><p>Note: keep in mind that ZkSync exit fees fluctuate and are linked to Ethereum Gas Prices. Checkout this tool that one of our developers created (in their free time) to track the fees: <a href="https://zk-tools.github.io/zk-fee/">https://zk-tools.github.io/zk-fee/</a></p><h3 id="what-do-i-need-to-do-if-i-m-eligible">What do I need to do if I’m eligible?</h3><p>If you’ve been a Provider on Golem for a while then you’ll most likely be eligible, and we’ve already collected the list of eligible Providers that we will be transferring tokens to the same address, on Polygon.</p><p><strong>Everything will be automatic as long as you’ve upgraded and continue to be online.</strong> Eligible users should upgrade to the Beta.IV release and be active on the network as Providers. Our subsidy tool will request a sample task on the Golem Network to check if your node is up and running. After successful computation the usual payment will be made and then (possibly after a few hours) a separate transaction with the subsidy amount will arrive to your account on Polygon. Transfers will begin today and we will cease the Subsidy process on Jan 15th, 2022. <strong>EDIT: due to issues and congestion on Polygon, the cease date will be extended by 7 days, until the 22nd of January.</strong></p><p>If you’re interested to learn more about Polygon token transfers and ways to interact with your GLM on Polygon, please see our <a href="https://youtu.be/oCU_KbeE0S8">Polygon Explained</a> video. And for the demonstration of exporting your keystore, please refer to this <a href="https://youtu.be/oCU_KbeE0S8?t=727">timestamp of the video</a>.</p><p>Just to highlight again, if you’re a Provider then don’t forget to update your node! <strong>Upgrading your node is required to be eligible for the subsidy.</strong></p><p>Before we finish up, we’d like to thank each and every Golem Provider for their commitment to contributing to the Golem project. The project wouldn’t be the same without each and every one of you! 🥰</p>',

    title: "Golem major release - Beta IV with Polygon support!",
    slug: "beta-iv-release",
    html: '<p>We’re excited to share the 4th major release announcement, the Beta IV. It’s only been a short time since the announcement of <a href="https://blog.golemproject.net/beta-iii-release/">Beta III</a>, which had a long list of improvements in terms of Golem features (VPN support, HTTP proxy, custom usage counters, etc.) and fixes. With this major release, the feature list is shorter but definitely just as significant! Beta IV now includes support for our new Polygon mainnet payment driver.</p><p>Beta IV includes <a href="https://github.com/golemfactory/yagna/releases/tag/v0.9.0">Yagna v0.9.0</a> (code-named <em>lleumia</em>) which is important for both requestors and providers. Both will need to upgrade for your node to be able to support Polygon. Over time we expect the vast majority of tasks to occur on Polygon. So for providers, in particular, you will miss out on the majority of tasks if your node is not updated.</p><p>The major release also includes <a href="https://github.com/golemfactory/yapapi/releases/tag/0.8.0">Yapapi v0.8.0</a> (code-named <em>Halifax Explosion</em>), which is needed for requestors to easily run tasks on Polygon using the Yagna Python API. In addition, our developers have included a <a href="https://github.com/golemfactory/yapapi/blob/master/examples/market-strategy/market_strategy.py">custom market strategy example</a> to assist requestors.</p><p>And the <a href="https://handbook.golem.network/requestor-tutorials/flash-tutorial-of-requestor-development">Golem handbook</a> has been updated with some resources focused on requestors.</p><h2 id="how-do-i-upgrade-or-install-golem-to-support-polygon">How do I upgrade or install Golem to support Polygon?</h2><p>To upgrade or install Golem, both will be the same for a requestor or a provider. <strong>It’s very important for providers to update or you will not be able to support tasks for Polygon</strong>. To be clear, you will get much fewer tasks as a provider if you don’t upgrade.</p><p><a href="https://handbook.golem.network/requestor-tutorials/flash-tutorial-of-requestor-development">Requestor</a>:</p><p><code>curl -sSf https://join.golem.network/as-requestor | bash -</code></p><p><a href="https://handbook.golem.network/provider-tutorials/provider-tutorial">Provider</a>:</p><p><code>curl -sSf https://join.golem.network/as-provider | bash -</code></p><h4 id="what-does-this-mean-for-glm-on-zksync">What does this mean for GLM on ZkSync?</h4><p>ZkSync will still be usable as a payment driver, just that we expect most tasks to gradually occur on Polygon, with it being the optimal mainnet payment driver for requestors. In the coming weeks, we will be introducing a GLM Provider Subsidy to help reimburse exit costs that providers and requestors might incur for exiting GLM from ZkSync to Ethereum. Until that announcement where we will elaborate much more, we\'d recommend not exiting any tokens from ZkSync.</p><h2 id="benefits-of-polygon">Benefits of Polygon</h2><p>In the video and sections below we will share how to get started as a provider and a requestor running mainnet tasks, along with the impacts of adding Polygon as a driver has for the Golem Network.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oCU_KbeE0S8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><figcaption>Getting started for both Golem providers and requestors using the new version and dive into the new Golem Polygon payment driver.</figcaption></figure><h4 id="fees">Fees</h4><p>Currently, on ZkSync, fees for transferring GLM are nearing 1 GLM per transaction. This is roughly $0.40 per payment for a Golem Network task or service. On Polygon requestors can expect to get transactions in the range of ~100-200x cheaper depending on the <a href="https://polygonscan.com/gastracker">Gas Price</a>.</p><p>Other benefits of the new payment driver include that finality on Polygon is fast, usually considered after 128 blocks (or ~5 minutes). In contrast, <a href="https://zkscan.io/">blocks on ZkSync</a> can often be pending for hours. Polygon will also help with addressing the Nonce Mismatch error that’s been coming up now and then on ZkSync for requestors.</p><h4 id="on-boarding-and-off-boarding">On-boarding and off-boarding</h4><p>As for off-boarding and on-boarding, this is MUCH cheaper compared to ZkSync. The cheapest off-boarding would be to convert GLM to USDC using <a href="https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x0b220b82f3ea3b7f6d9a1d8ab58930c064a2b5bf&amp;outputCurrency=0x2791bca1f2de4661ed88a30c99a7a9449aa84174">QuickSwap</a> (pair <a href="https://info.quickswap.exchange/#/pair/0x04E2dC96AfeCDf72221882e1cEE039CaB4D443E0">link</a>). USDC is supported on <a href="https://www.binance.com/">Binance</a> and <a href="https://www.gate.io/">Gate.io</a> as deposit methods directly from Polygon, without needing to exit/bridge to Ethereum. Keep in mind that deposits on Polygon can sometimes be restricted depending on Polygon network conditions. In the scenario that you need some MATIC for Gas, gasless swaps are usually also available (depending on network conditions) so you will be able to swap GLM to MATIC, paying the fees in GLM. Go to <a href="https://wallet.polygon.technology/swap/">wallet.polygon.network/swap</a> to see more. </p><p>As for requestors, the first time you run a task it will be on testnet. The flash tutorial will take care of everything related to funding your testnet address by following the <a href="https://handbook.golem.network/requestor-tutorials/flash-tutorial-of-requestor-development">requestor section of the handbook</a>.</p><p>For mainnet on-boarding as a developer and/or requestor after completing tasks on testnet, getting started for the first time on mainnet and running tasks on Polygon using real GLM, you can use our faucet. Join our <a href="https://chat.golem.network/">Discord</a>, head to the #funding channel, read the T&amp;Cs with /terms, then it’s just to follow the steps from there! The faucet will give out GLM and some MATIC for gas.</p><p>If you’d like to on-board GLM on your own after using the faucet, the quickest and cheapest way would be to buy USDC on Binance or Gate.io, withdraw on Polygon to your address, convert a small amount to MATIC with <a href="https://wallet.polygon.technology/swap/">gasless swaps</a> (to be used for Gas on Polygon), use <a href="https://info.quickswap.exchange/pair/0x04E2dC96AfeCDf72221882e1cEE039CaB4D443E0">QuickSwap</a> to convert USDC to GLM and you’re ready to run your mainnet tasks.</p><h4 id="ecosystem">Ecosystem</h4><p>Indirectly, Polygon has a vast ecosystem of DApps, DEXs, and DeFi that will be more easily accessible to the Golem community who want to use their GLM in various ways. See <a href="https://awesomepolygon.com/">Awesome Polygon</a> for the entire Polygon ecosystem overview.</p><h4 id="security">Security</h4><p>As security advice which we give in almost all releases, for both requestors and providers, you should be backing up your keys if you have mainnet tokens. You can back up your keys to your wallet with the export command (while Golem is running):</p><p><code>yagna id export --file-path=./key.json</code></p><p>If you’re just getting started with Golem for the first time, you want to go to the handbook. It includes the installation steps as a Provider or Requestor (video walk-through), along with explanations and important details such as Command-Line Interface (CLI).</p><h2 id="thank-you-">Thank you!</h2><p>Thank you for reading the Beta IV announcement. We look forward to receiving your feedback and learning about your experience. You can reach us via <a href="mailto:contact@golem.network">email</a>, <a href="https://chat.golem.network">Discord</a>, and please keep us in the loop with your newest endeavors when building on Golem, we’d be happy to include applications in <a href="https://github.com/golemfactory/awesome-golem">Awesome Golem</a>!</p><p>For developers, don’t forget that we have the <a href="https://blog.golemproject.net/glm-rewards-program-application-creation-and-maintenance/">Application Creation and Maintenance</a> category for the GLM Rewards Program.</p>',

    html: '<p>We are delighted to introduce you to the first Chess On Golem Tournament!</p><p><a href="https://github.com/broadcastmonkey/ChessOnGolem">Chess on Golem</a> is an app developed by our community member Paweł Burgchardt (aka Broadcast Monkey on Github) during our first hackathon in December, where human players can challenge a Golem-powered AI player in a game of chess across 5 levels, from beginner to Grandmaster.</p><p>The game is managed by Node.js server, which distributes tasks across providers on the Golem network: when it’s Golem’s turn, the move request is sent to the Golem Network and bidded by providers.</p><p>In the tournament, we will be <strong>giving away 30k GLM in prizes</strong> - read below to know how to win, and start playing <a href="https://chessongolem.app/">here</a>!</p><h2 id="rules">Rules</h2><p>Make sure you join the <a href="https://chat.golem.network/">Golem Discord</a>. The player has to log in and play with a unique username, this needs to be <strong>the first 8 characters as your Discord ID </strong>(or less if you don’t have 8 characters). You cannot play "as a guest". Players using the guest mode will not be considered for the competition prize.</p><p>Prizes will be awarded to the first 3 players who beat Golem at the "<em><strong>Chess Grandmaster Level</strong></em>" within the deadline - the first deadline will be 13th of December.</p><ul><li>The first player to claim the prize will win 15k GLM.</li><li>The second player to claim the prize will win 10k GLM.</li><li>The third player to claim the prize will win 5k GLM.</li></ul><p>If, by the deadline, 1 or more prizes have yet to be claimed, the remaining prize(s) will be awarded to the player(s) beating the "<em><strong>Chess Master Level</strong></em>", within the deadline - the second deadline will be 3rd of January.</p><p>If, by the deadline, 1 or more prizes have yet to be claimed, the remaining prize(s) will be awarded to the player(s) beating the "<em><strong>Experienced Level</strong></em>", within the deadline  - the second deadline will be 24th of January.</p><p>It is on a first come first served basis: if 3 prizes are won before the deadline, then the tournament will be considered completed.</p><p>There\'s no limit to the number of attempts a player can make.</p><p>Good faith: Players agree that other than the device which is being used for playing games (and has a screen-recording running), no electronic communication devices or chess playing aids are being used. A third-party software might be used to analyse whether a player might be cheating. <strong>The screen recording can only show one game</strong>. You need to play one game at a time. Do not DDoS the ChessOnGolem to try to win.</p><p>Players cheating (using 3rd party tools) will be disqualified and can be banned from participating in the game, and to any other Golem community initiatives, including (and not restricted to, at the discretion of Golem Factory GmbH): GLM Rewards Programs, bounties, hackathons.</p><p>Players tracing previous games can be flagged as using 3rd party tools with our analysis. We would <strong>highly recommend</strong> against this approach since there will be no simple way to prove that 3rd party tools weren\'t used within the information collected. If our analysis shows it\'s very likely 3rd party tools were used then this is the decision that will be used.</p><p>Individuals from the Golem Factory GmbH and its affiliate, as well as any developers that worked directly on the development of ChessOnGolem will be excluded from participating in the tournament.</p><p>Be aware that each individual player can only win one of the three prizes.</p><p>Each game can last a maximum of 1 hour. Golem Network computation time <strong>will not be included </strong>in the players time by the judges when the video is submitted. This means that the video can be longer than 1 hour (this can occur if there is congestion in the network).</p><h3 id="how-to-claim-your-prize">How to claim your prize</h3><p>You should email contact@golem.network with the title “Golem Chess Competition Submission” and include the following:</p><ol><li>Winners have to submit a video recording of their screen while they\'re playing. No other open tabs are allowed while playing.</li></ol><ul><li> The recording has to always show the time.</li><li> Doesn’t need audio, doesn’t need to be high quality (within reason that judges can see moves made).</li><li> In the case of disconnection a player may reconnect and return to the game, provided the video recording remains active during the disconnection. Disconnection time is not included towards the time limit.</li></ul><p>2.\tAt the end of the game you will have a game link, winners have to send the link of the game (i.e.<a href="https://chessongolem.app/game/350"> https://chessongolem.app/game/350</a>).</p><p>3.\tWinners also have to share this game link in the Golem Discord in the #chess-tournament channel, stating that they have beat the current difficulty. Please do this ASAP once you’ve completed the difficulty.</p><p>4.\tInclude your Discord ID (i.e. [MyName]#[XXXX]) and first name.</p><p>5.\tState that you accept the <a href="https://www.golem.network/privacy">privacy policy</a>.</p><p>You will be required to submit KYC in the case that you’re a winning candidate. The KYC documents for winning candidates and first name provided with the initial submission should match. A request for this information should be expected within 5 business days from the submission.</p><p>We understand that the requirements for this competition are relatively strict; considering the prize pool allows for an individual to win over 15,000 GLM and the total prize pool is 30,000 GLM, we believe that these requirements are reasonable. We hope that participants understand that requirements are strict to increase fairness of the competition.</p><p>Stages of the competition ("<em>Chess Grandmaster Level</em>" - November 19th to December 13th, "<em>Chess Master Level</em>" - December 14th to January 3rd, "<em>Experienced Level</em>" - January 4th to January 24th) are considered in CET timezone and from the beginning of the game.</p><h2 id="summary-to-participate">Summary to participate</h2><ol><li>Make sure you’re in the <a href="https://chat.golem.network/">Golem Discord</a>.</li><li>Go to <a href="https://chessongolem.app/">ChessOnGolem</a> and create your nickname with the first 8 characters of your Discord ID.</li><li>Set your difficulty level with the set difficulty level for the set time period:</li></ol><ul><li>"<em><strong>Chess Grandmaster Level</strong></em>" - November 19th to December 13th.</li><li>"<em><strong>Chess Master Level</strong></em>" - December 14th to January 3rd.</li><li>"<em><strong>Experienced Level</strong></em>" - January 4th to January 24th.</li></ul><p>4.\tRecord your game.</p><ul><li>Winning candidate submission must include a link to a video recording (e.g. Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.).
